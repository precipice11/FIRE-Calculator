# FIRE-Calculator


This is a simple web application to calculate the future value of an investment using the principles of the FIRE (Financial Independence, Retire Early) movement. The application allows you to calculate the total amount you could accumulate over a set period, considering contributions, interest rates, and compounding frequency. Additionally, it provides a breakdown of tax calculations to show your take-home income after taxes.

Features
Calculate the total investment amount with and without compound interest.
Visualize your investment growth with two interactive charts:
Total with interest.
Total without interest.
Calculate annual income from your investment based on a withdrawal rate (default is 4%).
Apply tax rates to calculate your after-tax income and monthly take-home.
How to Use
Starting Balance: Enter the initial amount you plan to invest.
Contribution: Enter the amount you will contribute to your investment monthly.
Years: Enter the number of years you plan to invest.
Interest Rate: Enter the average annual interest rate (in percentage).
Compound Frequency: Choose the frequency of compounding (Daily, Monthly, Annually).
Tax Percentage: Enter the tax percentage applied when withdrawing your investment.
Click the Calculate button to view your results.

How It Works
Without Interest: This shows how much money you would have if you invested the starting balance and made regular monthly contributions, without factoring in any interest.
With Interest: This shows the total amount after factoring in the interest earned over the investment period.
The application calculates the annual income you could generate by withdrawing a set percentage of your final investment (default is 4%).
The tax section calculates how much you'll take home after applying the entered tax rate to your annual income.
